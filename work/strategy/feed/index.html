										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We worked with Erck Rickmers, the founder of a new institute for advanced studies with a mission to become a platform for change addressing the urgent concerns of the modern world: democracy, the environment, the ethics of technology and the human condition. We developed a set of brand values and a strategy for inhabiting nine 19th century buildings in the heart of Hamburg. Bringing academics, activists and artists together under one roof with a shared goal meant creating an environment with a shared mindset, a democratic spirit and a clear point of view.</p>

Our concept removed any institutional feeling to make places that are comfortable, friction-free, easy to operate and a joy to spend time in. These are high-traffic public spaces in unnatural airport environments and our goal was to create rooms that make people feel human and good. This includes healthy and fresh, fast food, a beautiful bar, fantastic showers, natural materials and beautiful, practical furniture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first standalone store for the cult Australian skincare brand in the UK. We carefully restored the historic Mount Street space to bring the historic bones of the building to life. Contemporary interventions translated the brand’s strong values into a physical environment and retail experience that brought Aesop’s wellbeing philosophy to life. The concept became a template for the brand’s retail approach thereafter.</p>
