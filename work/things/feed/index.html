										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Holocene No.8 is a continuation of the idea of providing the fluttering beauty of candle light within a contained product concept. Holocene No.8 is an elegant solid brass concave disc that can be placed on any surface. It has a high-gloss reflective finish on the inside, a wide flat lip at its edge, and a brushed external finish. The centre of the disc has a spike for mounting a candle. This is a simple, accessible design, intended to create a lighting atmosphere, while embracing the joy of human interaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">An elegant and minimalist lighting collection for the Colombian/German company Ames, made in Colombia using local materials, skills and techniques. The lights come in four typologies: table top, floor standing and pendants in two sizes. They all feature a handmade, cone-shaped ceramic shade with a glazed inside that creates warm, gentle light. The upper side of the shade can be specified in five different colours, while the inner glaze can be either white or black. The lights are finished with a handwoven light fixture that uses the same weaving technique as panama hats and a textile cable available in three colours.</p>

Inspired by Bruno Munari&#8217;s celebrated 1944 poster &#8216;Seeking Comfort in an Uncomfortable Chair&#8217;, the Bruno chair is intended to accommodate new gestures and a different language of sitting. A simple design of good proportion, it has elegant curves which all face inwards, emphasising a sense of comfort and privacy. Made at SCP’s specialist upholstery factory in Norfolk, England, using natural and sustainable materials, with an FSC oak frame.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">An elegant collection of pots and pans, made from stainless steel and copper, which are designed to be easy to use and to cook efficiently. Consisting of two sizes of cooking pot, a saucepan and sauté pan, the collection has been created with smaller hands in mind. They are lightweight, with hollow handles that have a hole for hanging and an internal cast-iron plate that ensures they can be used on induction cookers as well as traditional stoves. They are also suitable for use in the oven and have stainless steel lids that reflect heat downwards. The external finish is copper, which will darken and tarnish over time, adding both character and patina to these daily use objects.</p>

First designed by Hans J. Wegner in 1949, the Wishbone chair (CH24) has been in continuous production ever since. We have selected nine matte colours that give the chair a new perspective. All colours are eco-friendly, water-based and resilient, so they are perfect for both private and public use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Touch is a collection of universal benches, trays and table lamps. Their special quality lies in the carved surfaces that engage our instinct to touch things, and reflect our hunger for more tactile surroundings in the digital age. The pieces are made in Bosnia using Zanat’s particular wood carving skills, that are designated an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO.</p>
<p>New additions to Studioilse’s ongoing collaboration with Zanat included a cabinet, console, table and series of stools. The collection adds value and contributes both to the sustainable socio-economic development and the preservation of Bosnian cultural heritage in an area devastated by war.</p>
