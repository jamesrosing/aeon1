										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were asked to work on a sensitive restoration of the landmark Helsinki restaurant, designed in 1937 by Alvar and Aino Aalto. Our approach took its cue from the original interior, peeling back the layers and introducing only subtle aspects to reinforce the original spirit. The Aaltos believed that one of the main missions of modern architecture was to “refine materials in a more humane direction”. And so do we. So-called ‘soft’ values are vital in a hard world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A decade since the opening of Ett Hem, the Stockholm guest house that redefined hospitality, Studioilse returned to work again with project founder Jeanette Mix. This time the expansion of Ett Hem into the house next door. Working from the same set of values and principles, the design seeks to create a feeling that is domestic and intimate, with comfort and ease, generosity and informality shaping the experience for everyone. Somewhere to house a wide range of cultural gatherings. Ett Hem Number 4 feels lively, dynamic and invigorating. Food has more visibility, local supply chains are key. Number 4 provides a series of public rooms that comfortably accommodate the Stockholm audience, these are expansive with a lot of daylight, while balconies provide views across the rooftops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our task was to turn the Kantor Centre, a 3200 sq m new building by architects Penoyre and Prasad, into a home for the Anna Freud Centre. It is a place for child mental health research, training and treatment centre, and sits alongside the Pears Family School for children excluded from mainstream school because of behavioural issues related to their mental health. Our goal was to de-institutionalise the institution and design somewhere that feels warm, calm, solid, safe and reassuring in difficult times. Our design supports and enables basic and complex human needs simultaneously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s3">NONA is a values driven company in Brussels, Belgium. We worked closely with them to develop their design strategy through the interior design of the pilot NONA Pasta and NONA pizza. Our strategy was led by their core value; the simple idea of doing good. Reuse, adding value and longevity became the three guiding principles for the whole project, and were rigorously applied to our interior concepts and the physical spaces. The result is three restaurants that feel local and lively. All of them use the existing architecture with minimal intervention. NONA works with a small number of local producers, through thick and thin. We applied this idea to the specification of the furniture, lighting and accessories.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We redesigned St Cuthbert’s community hall to become a functional and beautiful home for Refettorio Felix, a new community kitchen, dining hall and drop-in centre where healthy meals are provided for those living in socially vulnerable conditions. The interior is a warm and welcoming space to bring the community together. We used design to restore a sense of dignity. The project was conceived by Food for Soul, a non-profit organisation founded by Massimo Bottura to fight food waste in support of social inclusion – all meals are made using surplus supermarket stock.</p>
